                Quran
                (Surah Taha, 20:59-73) where Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) received divine guidance from Allah. It
                is
                where Allah instructed Moses to confront Pharaoh and deliver His message.

                non-Muslims

                        Prophet Moses (peace be upon him) holds great importance in Islam and is considered one of the
                        major prophets. His story is mentioned multiple times in the Quran, and he is recognized for his
                        leadership, prophethood, and miraculous experiences.

                        In the Quran, the story of Prophet Moses includes his birth, being placed in a basket in the
                        river by his mother to protect him from Pharaoh's decree to kill all male children, his rescue
                        by Pharaoh's wife, his upbringing in Pharaoh's palace, his mission as a prophet, and the
                        miracles he performed.

                        Rivers also hold symbolic significance in the Quran and Islamic tradition. They are often
                        associated with life, purification, and blessings. The mention of rivers in the Quran can be
                        found in various contexts, such as descriptions of paradise, the Garden of Eden, and blessings
                        bestowed upon the righteous.

                        If there is indeed a "Moosa River" in Quranic Park, it is likely designed to represent the river
                        associated with Prophet Moses' story. It may offer a thematic experience, providing visitors
                        with insights into the Quranic narrative, the historical significance of rivers in Islamic
                        culture, and the broader message of hope, faith, and divine guidance.
