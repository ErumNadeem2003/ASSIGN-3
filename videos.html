        <font face="cursive" size="3" color="black">Quranic Park is a unique and innovative project that aims to showcase various aspects of the Quran,
            Islam's holy book, through interactive exhibits, educational displays, and beautiful landscaping. The
            concept of Quranic Park is inspired by the idea of creating an environment where visitors can learn about
            the Quran, its teachings, and the cultural and historical context surrounding it in an engaging and
            immersive way.

            The park typically includes several zones or sections that highlight different themes and stories from the
            Quran. These zones may include recreations of scenes from the Quran, interactive exhibits explaining the
            verses, and beautiful gardens with plants mentioned in the Quran.

            The goal of Quranic Park is to promote understanding, appreciation, and respect for the Quran's message
            among both Muslims and non-Muslims. It offers an opportunity for visitors to explore Islamic culture and
            heritage, learn about the contributions of Islamic civilization, and gain insights into the significance of
            the Quran in shaping the lives of over a billion people worldwide.

            Given the significance of the Quran in the Islamic faith, Quranic Parks aim to become centers for
            educational and spiritual experiences, fostering an environment of peace, tolerance, and mutual
            understanding.</font>
